# udacity_nlp_p2
The second project in Natural Language Processing Nanodegree with Udacity, on machine translation.

In this notebook (part of it provided by Udacity) I build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline accepts English text as input and returns the French translation. The project has three parts:
  
  _Preprocess_ - convert text to sequence of integers.<br>
  _Models_ - create several deep neural networks which accept a sequence of integers as input and return a probability distribution over possible translations.<br>
  _Prediction_ - run the model on English text.
  
  The project uses: Python 3, NumPy, TensorFlow 1.x, Keras 2.x.
