# Machine Translation Project

## Outline

In this notebook (part of it provided by Udacity) I build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline accepts English text as input and returns the French translation. The project has three parts:

  - _Preprocess_ - convert text to sequence of integers.<br>
  - _Models_ - create several deep neural networks which accept a sequence of integers as input and return a probability distribution over possible translations.<br>
  - _Prediction_ - run the model on English text sample.


This is the second project for the  Natural Language Processing Nanodegree with Udacity.


# Setup

This project requires GPU acceleration to run efficiently.<br>
The project is written in: Python 3, NumPy, TensorFlow 1.x, Keras 2.x.
